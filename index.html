                    <h3>Montessori Program</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the Montessori tradition, each class is a prepared environment alive with a wealth of intriguing materials. 
                        The child moves at his/her own pace through all areas of the room â€“ Practical Life, Sensorial, Language, Mathematics and Cultural.

                    <h3>Art Class</h3>
                    <p>
                        In order to encourage creativity, the art program involves exploration with a wide variety of media, techniques, and colour, and reinforces Montessori principles. 
                        Children, in small groups, are scheduled to participate in art activities in the art room on a once weekly basis.

                    <p>
                        French is introduced to all the children weekly. The emphasis is on vocabulary building through themes, songs, puppets and conversation. 
                        Additional French time is provided for the kindergarten students.
